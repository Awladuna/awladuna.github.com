Qamoosi teaches basic reading skills to little kids in a fun, colorful way. This game includes more than 80 words in seven different categories. This educational app is designed for kids ages two to seven.

In the main screen, select from seven categories: colors, animals, numbers, food, furniture, nature, and transportation. The aim of the game is to arrange the letters in the correct order to make the word. All letters are pronounced when touched. When the word is correctly completed, the whole word is pronounced and the kid can start coloring the picture.

Qamoosi teaches kids pronunciation, spelling, and word-picture association. An absolutely fun way to learn how to read!
