<h2>Awladuna Privacy Policy</h2>
<span class="pull-right">Last updated: November 2015</span>

<p>
For questions and information about Privacy Policy, please contact us at questions@awladuna.org.
For information about our privacy practices related to data from children, please see “Special Note About Children’s Privacy” below.
</p>

<p>
<strong>All Awladuna Services are governed by this Privacy Policy and by using or accessing a Service You give consent to the processing, use and disclosure of your data. Please do not install or use the Services if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy.
Awladuna reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.
</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>1. Ad Serving Technology</strong>
</p>

<p>
Awladuna reserves the right to use and disclose the collected, non-personal data for purposes of advertising by Awladuna or Awladuna’s partners and contractors.
Awladuna may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services.
Awladuna or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and geo-location information (for more information regarding use of Location Data see below Section 3) as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that relevant advertising is presented within the Service. Awladuna or third parties may collect and use data, for such purposes, including but not limited to, data such as IP address, Device ID, MAC address, installed software, application usage data, hardware type, Operating System information, browser information, unique identifiers in browser cookies, Flash cookies, and HTML5 local storage, Internet and on-line usage information and in-game information.
The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
Awladuna may display to you behaviorally targeted advertising. If you wish to "opt out" of certain targeted advertising, please visit http://www.youradchoices.com and/or www.networkadvertising.org. Please note that the links above may not reach all Awladuna’s advertising partners and certain behaviorally targeted advertising may still be displayed to you. If you want to be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are displayed to you, please do not use or access the Services.
Some services may include the use of in-game advertisements or brand placement. Such ads or sponsorships will be noted as such within the games.
Additionally please note that if you “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.
</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Location Data</strong>
</p>

<p>
To the extent Awladuna makes location enabled Services available and you use such Services, Awladuna may collect and process your location data to provide location related Services and advertisements. For example, some add-ons or offers may be available at dedicated locations.
Awladuna may use (1) coarse, network-based geo-location data based on proximity of network towers or the location of WiFi networks, (2) fine geo-location data based on coordinates obtained from a mobile device’s GPS radio, or (3) IP-based location based on the IP address presented by the end-user.
Your fine, GPS-based geo-location is not accessed without your consent. Notwithstanding Awladuna’s partners who are providing location related parts of the Service, Awladuna will not share your GPS geo-location with third parties without your consent. To the extent Awladuna makes available GPS geo-location to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy, it will be provided anonymously.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Analytics</strong>
</p>

<p>
Awladuna uses your information to perform its own analytics and to enable analytics provided by third parties. We use analytical information for supporting business analysis and operations, business intelligence, product development, improving products and services, personalizing content, providing advertising, and making recommendations. Awladuna may also use third-parties, such as a Flurry in order to develop and analyze use of the Services. For more information about Flurry and its services please see http://www.flurry.com/.
</p>

<p>
<strong>4. Children’s Privacy</strong>
</p>

<p>
Awladuna does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If Awladuna learns that Awladuna has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, Awladuna will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from Awladuna’s records.
Awladuna understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children under 13. To that end, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. Awladuna also does not allow our third party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.
Awladuna and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of that nation.
Awladuna and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. Awladuna also uses this data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a game). Awladuna and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.
Please note that Awladuna’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes. While Awladuna requires that companies comply with Awladuna’s privacy policy before Awladuna allows those companies to access our sites and services, Awladuna does not actually control third-party data collection and use. Awladuna encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties policies and practices.
In the future, should Awladuna incorporate features for which collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 is necessary, Awladuna will:
- Provide parents with notice about what information we may collect from children, how Awladuna will use that information and to whom it may be disclosed
- Obtain prior consent from parents for collection, use and disclosure of data from children when applicable
- Limit the collection of personal information from children to only that which is reasonably necessary for participation in a particular site or service activity
- Provide information to parents about how they can request to review the information that Awladuna has collected from their child and to request that Awladuna delete such information.
If you have additional questions about Awladuna’s Privacy Practices related to children under the age of 13, please contact us at privacy@Awladuna.com, or alternatively at Awladuna., Legal Department, Keilaranta 17 C, 02150 Espoo, Finland.
